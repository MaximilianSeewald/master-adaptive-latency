# Adaptive Latency Compensation in First-Person Shooters using Artificial Neural Networks


### Arduino-Delay:

Scripts for the Arduino to delay mouse and keyboard and send inputs via serial.

### Artificial-Delay [DISCONTINUED]:

Script used for the creation of artificial delay. Discontinued due to the usage of the Arduino and hardware limitations.

### Final-Study:

Contains the used NN. Run startStudy.py to start the evaluation study. Prediction100.py and Prediction150.py using the NN for input prediction. CreateDelay.py was used for the randomized delay Arrays.

### Neural-Network:

All the 3 trained NNs. All 3 trainings scripts for the NNs. Also contains YoloV5 trainingData + Yolov5 trainScript. VisualizeTraining.py starts tensorboard and visualizes training results.

### Preprocessing:

Scripts for combining and preprocessing the data for the usage in the training of the NNs.

### PreStudy [DISCONTINUED]:

Old prestudy scripts, were discontinued due to usage of the Arduino.

### Prestudy-with-Arduino:

Scripts used for the data collection study.

### USB_Host_Shield_Library_2.0 [CHANGED]:

Contains all files of the Host Shield library. Some files are altered for own usage.
